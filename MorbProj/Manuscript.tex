\begin{abstract}
This is important stuff!
\end{abstract}

Age standardization is an essential tool for the contemporary practice of
demography. Demographers age-standardize in order to assess trends and
intensities in rates that vary in regular ways over age free from distortion in
population structure. Without age standardization or its many cognates, we
would judge trends and magnitudes based on crude rates, which are now understood
not to carry the same predictive utility as rates that have been purged of
structure. This is a cornerstone tenet of contemporary demography. Typically, in
order to drive the point home, instructors find or concoct an example where a
comparison of age-standardized rates leads to the opposite conclusion as crude
rates suggest. This is quite motivating for the pupil, and it soon become second
nature. This is the point we wish to remake with respect to unaccounted-for
temporal variation in rates that are not vital rates.

Some processes vary over the life course, that is to say, within and over the
lives of individuals. If members of the same birth cohort are thought to have
something in common, it will surely be the case that members of the same birth
cohort that also end up dying in the same year share even more features in their
life course: Different aspects of their lives will on average align in
empirically regular ways. In general, persons dying in the same year probably
share many characteristics in the time prior to death, especially persons that
die of intrisic or unavoidable mortality. This empirical
alignment will in some cases hold, even if the persons are not from proximate
birth cohorts. That is to say, for some conditions, temporal variation in terms
of remaining years of life, or completed lifespan provides sharper and more
regular relief than variation in terms of chronological age. In such instances,
age standardization of the common variety does not provide the degree of
control or precision that we may believe it does.
